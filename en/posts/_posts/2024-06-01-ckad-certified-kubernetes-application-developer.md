# CKAD: Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (2024)

* UNORDERED TOC
{:toc .large-only}

## 1. About the Certification

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in collaboration with The Linux Foundation to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. The CKAD program allows individuals to demonstrate their competence in designing, building, and deploying cloud-native applications for Kubernetes. Commonly, developers are mainly responsible for making workloads in Kubernetes.

Similar to the CKA exam, the CKAD exam is a hands-on, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple issues from a command line running Kubernetes. The exam focuses on the skills required to be a Kubernetes Application Developer in industry-ready work environments.

My CKAD certification 2024. Issued on June 1, 2024. Expires on May 31, 2026. You can verify my certification [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/9e072a3a-57d0-403e-8bef-5831d618675c).

I took the CKAD exam on May 31, 2024, and passed it successfully. The exam was challenging, and I achieved a score that met the passing requirements. I prepared for the exam by studying the official Kubernetes documentation, taking online courses, and practicing with Kubernetes clusters in KodeKloud.
